# Withdrawal Fee System Implementation

## Overview
Comprehensive tiered withdrawal fee system that automatically deducts fees from withdrawal amounts based on transaction size and payment method. Fees are tracked separately in admin transaction listings and are not directly notified to users.

---

## Fee Structure

### Base Fees (in RWF)

| Tier | Amount Range | Fee | Doubled Fee (Card/Bank) |
|------|--------------|-----|------------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Up to 1,000,000 RWF (~$769 USD) | 600 RWF (~$0.46 USD) | 1,200 RWF (~$0.92 USD) |
| **Tier 2** | 1,000,001 - 5,000,000 RWF (~$769-$3,846 USD) | 1,200 RWF (~$0.92 USD) | 2,400 RWF (~$1.85 USD) |
| **Tier 3** | Above 5,000,000 RWF (~$3,846+ USD) | 3,000 RWF (~$2.31 USD) | 6,000 RWF (~$4.62 USD) |

### Fee Doubling Rules

Fees are **doubled** for the following payment methods (higher processing costs):
- `CARD`
- `BANK`
- `BANK_TRANSFER`
- `VISA`
- `MASTERCARD`

Fees are **standard** (not doubled) for:
- `MOBILE`
- `MOBILE_MONEY`

---

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User requests withdrawal**
   - User specifies amount (e.g., 1,000 USD)
   - User can optionally call `/api/payments/withdrawal/calculate-fee` to see fee breakdown

2. **Fee calculation (automatic)**
   - System determines tier based on amount
   - System checks payment method to determine if fee should be doubled
   - Fee is calculated and deducted from requested amount
   - Example:
     - User requests 1,000 USD via mobile money
     - Fee: 0.92 USD (Tier 2, not doubled)
     - User receives: 999.08 USD

3. **Withdrawal processing**
   - Full amount (1,000 USD) is deducted from user's wallet balance
   - Net amount (999.08 USD) is sent to payment provider
   - Fee (0.92 USD) is recorded in admin transaction listing

4. **User notification**
   - User is NOT explicitly notified about the fee deduction
   - User sees "Withdrawal processed successfully" with net amount received

### Admin Flow

1. **Admin approves withdrawal**
   - System automatically calculates fee
   - Creates two transaction records:
     - **Withdrawal transaction**: Net amount sent to user
     - **Fee transaction**: Fee collected by platform

2. **Admin views transactions**
   - Both withdrawal and fee transactions appear in admin listing
   - Fee transaction clearly labeled as "WITHDRAWAL_FEE"
   - Includes tier information and original/net amounts

## API Endpoints

### 1. Calculate Withdrawal Fee (New)
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/payments/withdrawal/calculate-fee`

**Purpose**: Allow users to see fee breakdown before confirming withdrawal

**Request**:
```json
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "method": "MOBILE_MONEY"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,

    "feeTier": "Tier 2 (1M-5M RWF)",
    "currency": "USD",
    "feePercentage": "0.09"
  }
}
```

### 2. Get Withdrawal Info (Updated)

## Implementation Files

### 1. src/utils/withdrawal-fee.utility.ts (NEW)
**Purpose**: Core fee calculation logic

**Key Functions**:

#### `calculateWithdrawalFee(amount, currency, isDoubled)`
Calculates withdrawal fee based on amount and method.

```typescript
const feeCalculation = calculateWithdrawalFee(1000, 'USD', false);
// Returns:
// {
//   originalAmount: 1000,
//   feeAmount: 0.92,
//   netAmount: 999.08,
//   feeTier: 'Tier 2 (1M-5M RWF)',
//   currency: 'USD',
//   isDoubled: false
// }
```

#### `shouldDoubleFee(paymentMethod)`
Determines if fee should be doubled based on payment method.

```typescript
shouldDoubleFee('MOBILE_MONEY'); // false
shouldDoubleFee('CARD');         // true
shouldDoubleFee('BANK');         // true
```

#### `validateWithdrawalWithFee(amount, currency, isDoubled)`
Validates that withdrawal amount is sufficient to cover fee.

```typescript
const validation = validateWithdrawalWithFee(500, 'RWF', true);
// Returns:
// {
//   valid: false,
//   error: 'Withdrawal amount (500 RWF) is insufficient to cover withdrawal fee (1200 RWF)'
// }
```

#### `formatFeeForAdmin(calculation)`
Formats fee information for admin display.

```typescript
const formatted = formatFeeForAdmin(feeCalculation);
// Returns: "Withdrawal Fee: 0.92 USD (Tier 2 (1M-5M RWF))"
```

---

### 2. src/services/admin.service.ts (MODIFIED)
**Changes**: Integrated fee calculation into withdrawal approval process

**Line 9**: Added import
```typescript
import { calculateWithdrawalFee, shouldDoubleFee, validateWithdrawalWithFee, formatFeeForAdmin } from '../utils/withdrawal-fee.utility';
```

**Lines 3398-3420**: Fee calculation before payout
```typescript
// STEP: Calculate withdrawal fee
const isDoubleFee = shouldDoubleFee(accountInfo.methodType);
const feeValidation = validateWithdrawalWithFee(withdrawal.amount, withdrawal.currency, isDoubleFee);

if (!feeValidation.valid) {
  throw new Error(feeValidation.error);
}

const feeCalculation = feeValidation.calculation!;
const withdrawalFee = feeCalculation.feeAmount;
const netAmount = feeCalculation.netAmount; // Amount user actually receives

let feeTransaction;
```

**Lines 3437-3487**: Updated transaction creation
- **Withdrawal transaction**: Uses `netAmount` (what user receives)
- **Fee transaction**: Separate record for admin tracking

```typescript
// Create payment transaction record (using net amount)
paymentTransaction = await prisma.paymentTransaction.create({
  data: {
    amount: netAmount, // Net amount after fee deduction
    metadata: {
      withdrawalFee: withdrawalFee,
      originalAmount: withdrawal.amount,
      netAmount: netAmount,
      feeTier: feeCalculation.feeTier
    }
  }
});

// Create separate transaction record for the withdrawal fee
feeTransaction = await prisma.paymentTransaction.create({
  data: {
    type: 'WITHDRAWAL_FEE',
    amount: withdrawalFee,
    status: 'COMPLETED',
    reference: `FEE-${withdrawal.reference}-${Date.now()}`,
    description: formatFeeForAdmin(feeCalculation),
    metadata: {
      withdrawalRequestId: withdrawalId,
      withdrawalReference: withdrawal.reference,
      originalAmount: withdrawal.amount,
      netAmount: netAmount,
      feeTier: feeCalculation.feeTier,
      isDoubled: isDoubleFee
    }
  }
});
```

**Line 3497**: Updated XentriPay payout amount
```typescript
amount: netAmount // Send net amount (original amount - fee)
```

---

### 3. src/routes/withdrawal.routes.ts (MODIFIED)
**Changes**: Added fee calculation endpoint and updated info endpoint

**Line 11**: Added import
```typescript
import { calculateWithdrawalFee, shouldDoubleFee } from '../utils/withdrawal-fee.utility';
```

**Lines 51-90**: New `/calculate-fee` endpoint
- Allows users to preview fee before confirming withdrawal
- Returns original amount, fee, and net amount

**Lines 755-772**: Updated `/info` endpoint
- Added complete fee structure information
- Shows fees for all tiers
- Includes doubled fee amounts for card/bank

---

### 4. src/scripts/test-withdrawal-fees.ts (NEW)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test suite for fee calculation

**Test Coverage**:

## Database Changes

### PaymentTransaction Type
Added new transaction type: `WITHDRAWAL_FEE`

**Example Fee Transaction**:
```json
{
  "id": "clx...",
  "userId": 123,
  "type": "WITHDRAWAL_FEE",
  "method": "MOBILE_MONEY",
  "amount": 0.92,
  "currency": "USD",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "reference": "FEE-WD-20250127-001-1706380234567",
  "description": "Withdrawal Fee: 0.92 USD (Tier 2 (1M-5M RWF))",
  "metadata": {
    "withdrawalRequestId": "clx123...",
    "withdrawalReference": "WD-20250127-001",
    "originalAmount": 1000,
    "netAmount": 999.08,
    "feeTier": "Tier 2 (1M-5M RWF)",
    "isDoubled": false
  }
}
```

---

## Fee Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Small Mobile Money Withdrawal
```
User requests: 100 USD via MOBILE_MONEY
Tier: Tier 1 (100 USD = 130,000 RWF < 1M RWF)
Fee: 600 RWF = 0.46 USD (not doubled)
User receives: 99.54 USD
Platform keeps: 0.46 USD
```

### Example 2: Medium Bank Withdrawal
```
User requests: 2,000 USD via BANK
Tier: Tier 2 (2,000 USD = 2.6M RWF, between 1M-5M RWF)
Base fee: 1,200 RWF = 0.92 USD
Doubled (bank): 2,400 RWF = 1.85 USD
User receives: 1,998.15 USD
Platform keeps: 1.85 USD
```

### Example 3: Large Mobile Money Withdrawal
```
User requests: 4,000 USD via MOBILE_MONEY
Tier: Tier 3 (4,000 USD = 5.2M RWF > 5M RWF)
Fee: 3,000 RWF = 2.31 USD (not doubled)
User receives: 3,997.69 USD
Platform keeps: 2.31 USD
```

---

## Admin Transaction Listing

### Query for All Withdrawal Fees
```typescript
const withdrawalFees = await prisma.paymentTransaction.findMany({
  where: {
    type: 'WITHDRAWAL_FEE',
    status: 'COMPLETED'
  },
  orderBy: {
    createdAt: 'desc'
  }
});
```

### Fee Revenue Report
```typescript
const totalFees = await prisma.paymentTransaction.aggregate({
  where: {
    type: 'WITHDRAWAL_FEE',
    status: 'COMPLETED'
  },
  _sum: {
    amount: true
  },
  _count: {
    id: true
  }
});

console.log(`Total withdrawal fees collected: ${totalFees._sum.amount} USD`);
console.log(`Total withdrawals processed: ${totalFees._count.id}`);
```

---

## User Communication Strategy

### DO NOT Explicitly Notify About Fees
As per user requirement, fees are **deducted automatically without user notification**.

However, fees can be made **transparent through**:
1. Fee calculation endpoint (allows users to preview before confirming)
2. Withdrawal info endpoint (shows fee structure)
3. Terms of service / FAQ page
4. Net amount shown in confirmation message

### Example User-Facing Messages

**Withdrawal Request Confirmation**:
```
âœ… Withdrawal processed successfully!

Amount sent: 999.08 USD
Method: Mobile Money
Reference: WD-20250127-001
Estimated delivery: 1-3 business days
```

**Pre-Withdrawal Preview** (optional, if UI implements):
```
Withdrawal Preview:
Requested: 1,000.00 USD
Processing fee: 0.92 USD
You will receive: 999.08 USD

[ Confirm Withdrawal ] [ Cancel ]
```

## Fee Percentage Analysis

| Amount (USD) | Tier | Standard Fee | Fee % | Doubled Fee | Doubled % |
|-------------|------|--------------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 100 | 1 | 0.46 | 0.46% | 0.92 | 0.92% |
| 500 | 1 | 0.46 | 0.09% | 0.92 | 0.18% |
| 769 | 1 | 0.46 | 0.06% | 0.92 | 0.12% |
| 1,000 | 2 | 0.92 | 0.09% | 1.85 | 0.19% |
| 2,000 | 2 | 0.92 | 0.05% | 1.85 | 0.09% |
| 3,846 | 2 | 0.92 | 0.02% | 1.85 | 0.05% |
| 4,000 | 3 | 2.31 | 0.06% | 4.62 | 0.12% |
| 10,000 | 3 | 2.31 | 0.02% | 4.62 | 0.05% |

**Key Insight**: Fees are very competitive, ranging from 0.02% to 0.92% depending on amount and method.

---

## Configuration & Customization

### Changing Fee Amounts
Edit [src/utils/withdrawal-fee.utility.ts](src/utils/withdrawal-fee.utility.ts):

```typescript
// Line 42-51
if (amountInRWF <= 1000000) {
  baseFee = 600; // Change this value
  feeTier = 'Tier 1 (Up to 1M RWF)';
} else if (amountInRWF <= 5000000) {
  baseFee = 1200; // Change this value
  feeTier = 'Tier 2 (1M-5M RWF)';
} else {
  baseFee = 3000; // Change this value
  feeTier = 'Tier 3 (Above 5M RWF)';
}
```

### Changing Fee Doubling Rules
Edit [src/utils/withdrawal-fee.utility.ts](src/utils/withdrawal-fee.utility.ts):

```typescript
// Line 82
const doubledMethods = ['CARD', 'BANK', 'BANK_TRANSFER', 'VISA', 'MASTERCARD'];
// Add or remove methods from this array
```

### Adding New Tiers
```typescript
// Example: Add Tier 4 for very large withdrawals
if (amountInRWF <= 1000000) {
  baseFee = 600;
  feeTier = 'Tier 1';
} else if (amountInRWF <= 5000000) {
  baseFee = 1200;
  feeTier = 'Tier 2';
} else if (amountInRWF <= 10000000) {
  baseFee = 3000;
  feeTier = 'Tier 3';
} else {
  baseFee = 5000; // NEW TIER
  feeTier = 'Tier 4 (Above 10M RWF)';
}
```

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Fee Revenue**
   - Total fees collected per day/week/month
   - Average fee per withdrawal
   - Fee revenue by tier

2. **Withdrawal Volume**
   - Total withdrawals processed
   - Average withdrawal amount
   - Distribution across tiers

3. **Method Usage**
   - Mobile money vs card/bank withdrawals
   - Impact of doubled fees on method preference

4. **User Behavior**
   - Use of `/calculate-fee` endpoint (fee preview)
   - Withdrawal amount clustering around tier boundaries

### Sample Analytics Queries

**Daily Fee Revenue**:
```typescript
const dailyFees = await prisma.paymentTransaction.groupBy({
  by: ['createdAt'],
  where: {
    type: 'WITHDRAWAL_FEE',
    status: 'COMPLETED',
    createdAt: {
      gte: new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // Last 30 days
    }
  },
  _sum: {
    amount: true
  }
});
```

**Tier Distribution**:
```typescript
const tierDistribution = await prisma.$queryRaw`
  SELECT
    metadata->>'feeTier' as tier,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(amount) as total_fees
  FROM payment_transactions
  WHERE type = 'WITHDRAWAL_FEE'
  AND status = 'COMPLETED'
  GROUP BY metadata->>'feeTier'
  ORDER BY total_fees DESC
`;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Fee calculation incorrect
**Solution**: Run test suite to identify which tier is failing
```bash
npx ts-node src/scripts/test-withdrawal-fees.ts
```

### Issue: User receives wrong amount
**Check**:
1. Withdrawal transaction amount (should be net amount)
2. XentriPay payout request amount (should be net amount)
3. Fee transaction exists and has correct amount
4. Wallet deduction is for full amount

### Issue: Fee not appearing in admin listing
**Check**:
1. Filter includes `type: 'WITHDRAWAL_FEE'`
2. Transaction was created during approval
3. Status is `COMPLETED`
