# Property Payment (Pay at Property) - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented "Pay at Property" functionality allowing guests to select cash payment at check-in instead of online payment.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes
**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

**New Booking Model Fields:**
```prisma
model Booking {
  // ... existing fields ...

  paymentMethod        String? // "momo", "card", "property"

  // Pay at property fields
  payAtProperty        Boolean   @default(false)
  propertyPaymentCollected Boolean @default(false)
  propertyPaymentCollectedAt DateTime?
  propertyPaymentCollectedBy Int?
  propertyPaymentAmount Float?
}
```

**New Transaction Provider:**
- Added `PROPERTY` as a valid provider in Transaction model
- Payment method: `cash_at_property`
- Status: `PENDING_PROPERTY_PAYMENT`

### 2. Backend API Implementation

### 3. Transaction List Enhancements

All transaction endpoints now include payment type classification:

**GET /api/transactions** (with new fields)

**Response includes:**

  "count": 50,
  "summary": {
    "total": 50,
    "cashPayments": 12,

      "reference": "PROP-1234567890-ABC",
      "provider": "PROPERTY",
      "paymentMethod": "cash_at_property",
      "status": "PENDING_PROPERTY_PAYMENT",
      "amount": 100500,
      "currency": "RWF",

      // NEW FIELDS FOR ADMIN

## Admin Transaction List Features

### Filter Capabilities
```javascript
// Get all cash payments
GET /api/transactions?paymentMethod=cash_at_property

// Get all property payments (same as above)
GET /api/transactions?provider=PROPERTY

// Get all online payments
GET /api/transactions?provider=PAWAPAY
GET /api/transactions?provider=XENTRIPAY

// Get pending property payments
GET /api/transactions?status=PENDING_PROPERTY_PAYMENT

// Combine filters
GET /api/transactions?paymentMethod=cash_at_property&status=PENDING_PROPERTY_PAYMENT
```

### Visual Indicators (Frontend Implementation)
The enhanced response makes it easy to add visual badges:

```tsx
// Example frontend code
{transaction.isCashPayment ? (
  <Badge variant="warning">
    ðŸ’µ {transaction.paymentTypeLabel}
  </Badge>
) : (
  <Badge variant="success">
    ðŸ’³ {transaction.paymentTypeLabel}
  </Badge>
)}
```

### Payment Type Labels
- `"Cash at Property"` - Property payment (cash)
- `"Mobile Money (Online)"` - PawaPay mobile money
- `"Card Payment (Online)"` - XentriPay card payment
- `"Online Payment"` - Generic online payment

## Testing Checklist

### Property Payment Flow
- [ ] Guest selects "Pay at Property" during booking
- [ ] Booking is created with `payAtProperty: true`
- [ ] Transaction is created with provider `PROPERTY`
- [ ] Booking status is `confirmed` even though payment is pending
- [ ] Host can see pending property payment in their dashboard
- [ ] Host can mark payment as collected
- [ ] Transaction status updates to `COMPLETED` after collection
- [ ] Payment distribution occurs after collection

### Admin Transaction List
- [ ] All transactions show `paymentType` field
- [ ] All transactions show `paymentTypeLabel` field
- [ ] Cash payments have `isCashPayment: true`
- [ ] Online payments have `isOnlinePayment: true`
- [ ] Summary shows correct count of cash vs online payments
- [ ] Filter by `paymentMethod=cash_at_property` works
- [ ] Filter by `provider=PROPERTY` works

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Property payment doesn't trigger PawaPay/XentriPay
- [ ] Exchange rate is still calculated for reference
- [ ] 5% service fee is included in amount
- [ ] Booking confirmation email mentions "pay at property"
- [ ] Host notification about pending cash payment

## Frontend Integration

### 1. Booking Payment Selection (Already Done âœ…)
Your frontend already has the UI! Just ensure the JSON matches:
```json
{
  "paymentMethod": "property",
  "amount": 100,
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "phoneNumber": "0780000000",
  "description": "Booking payment",
  "internalReference": "BOOKING-123"
}
```

### 2. Admin Transaction List (Todo)
Add visual indicators for payment types:
```tsx
<TransactionTable>
  {transactions.map(tx => (
    <tr key={tx.id}>
      <td>{tx.reference}</td>
      <td>
        {tx.isCashPayment ? (
          <Badge color="orange">ðŸ’µ Cash at Property</Badge>
        ) : (
          <Badge color="green">ðŸ’³ {tx.paymentTypeLabel}</Badge>
        )}
      </td>
      <td>{tx.amount} {tx.currency}</td>
      <td>{tx.status}</td>
    </tr>
  ))}
</TransactionTable>
```

### 3. Host Dashboard (Todo)
Display pending property payments:
```tsx
const PendingPropertyPayments = ({ hostId }) => {
  const { data } = useFetch(`/api/transactions/property-payments/pending/${hostId}`);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Pending Cash Payments ({data?.count})</h2>
      {data?.data.map(booking => (
        <Card key={booking.id}>
          <h3>{booking.guest.firstName} {booking.guest.lastName}</h3>
          <p>Check-in: {booking.checkIn}</p>
          <p>Amount: ${booking.totalPrice}</p>
          <Button onClick={() => markAsCollected(booking.id)}>
            Mark as Collected
          </Button>
        </Card>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Next Steps

1. **Restart dev server** to regenerate Prisma client
2. **Test the property payment flow** end-to-end
3. **Update frontend admin panel** to show payment type badges
4. **Add host dashboard** for pending property payments
5. **Optional: Add email notifications** for property payment collection
6. **Optional: Add payment collection verification** (photo upload, receipt)

---

## Key Benefits

âœ… **For Guests:**
- Flexibility to pay at property
- No need for card/mobile money
- Booking confirmed immediately

âœ… **For Hosts:**
- Clear dashboard of pending cash payments
- Easy collection tracking
- Automated status updates

âœ… **For Admins:**
- Clear visibility of cash vs online payments
- Easy filtering by payment type
- Summary statistics in transaction list
- Better financial reporting

---

## Notes

- **5% Service Fee:** Currently mentioned in response message but calculation should be done on frontend before sending amount
- **Exchange Rate:** Still calculated for property payments for reference/reporting
- **Booking Confirmation:** Bookings with property payment are confirmed immediately (status: `confirmed`) but payment status is `pending_property`
- **Wallet Distribution:** Only occurs after host marks payment as collected
