# Withdrawal Fee Enforcement System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive withdrawal fee enforcement system that ensures users **NEVER** receive withdrawal amounts without the proper fee being deducted.

## Problem Statement

Previously, there was a critical gap in the withdrawal flow:
1. User requested withdrawal for amount X
2. Full amount X was deducted from wallet
3. Admin approved withdrawal and calculated fee at approval time
4. Net amount (X - fee) was sent to payment provider
5. **Result: User essentially received the fee back because full amount was locked**

## Solution

The new system enforces fee deduction at **EVERY** stage of the withdrawal process:

### 1. Database Schema Changes

**File: `prisma/schema.prisma`**

Added three new fields to `WithdrawalRequest` model:

```prisma
model WithdrawalRequest {
  // ... existing fields
  feeAmount          Float             @default(0)
  netAmount          Float?
  feeTier            String?
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

- `feeAmount`: The withdrawal fee amount (in USD)
- `netAmount`: The amount user will actually receive (amount - feeAmount)
- `feeTier`: Fee tier information for auditing (e.g., "Tier 1 (Up to 1M RWF)")

### 2. User Withdrawal Request Flow

**File: `src/routes/withdrawal.routes.ts:399-424`**

#### Changes Made:

1. **Fee Calculation at Request Time** (line 401-402):
   ```typescript
   const isDoubleFee = shouldDoubleFee(method);
   const feeCalculation = calculateWithdrawalFee(amount, 'USD', isDoubleFee);
   ```

2. **Critical Validation** (line 413-424):
   - Validates that withdrawal amount is sufficient to cover the fee
   - Rejects request if `netAmount <= 0`
   - Returns clear error message with fee breakdown

3. **Store Fee Information** (line 429-443):
   ```typescript
   const withdrawal = await prisma.withdrawalRequest.create({
     data: {
       userId,
       amount: amount,
       feeAmount: feeCalculation.feeAmount,
       netAmount: feeCalculation.netAmount,
       feeTier: feeCalculation.feeTier,
       // ... other fields
     }
   });
   ```

4. **Clear User Communication** (line 505-509):
   - Response includes fee breakdown
   - Message clearly states: "You will receive ${netAmount} USD after deducting the ${feeAmount} USD withdrawal fee"

### 3. Admin Approval Flow

**File: `src/services/admin.service.ts:3398-3445`**

#### Changes Made:

1. **Use Stored Fee Values** (line 3404-3416):
   ```typescript
   if (withdrawal.feeAmount && withdrawal.netAmount) {
     // Use fee calculated during user request
     withdrawalFee = withdrawal.feeAmount;
     netAmount = withdrawal.netAmount;
     feeTier = withdrawal.feeTier || 'Unknown';
   }
   ```

2. **Legacy Support** (line 3417-3440):
   - For old withdrawal requests without fee data, calculates fee on the fly
   - Ensures backward compatibility

3. **Critical Validation** (line 3442-3445):
   ```typescript
   if (netAmount <= 0) {
     throw new Error(`Invalid withdrawal: net amount must be positive`);
   }
   ```

4. **Send Net Amount to Payment Provider** (line 3519-3528):
   - XentriPay receives `netAmount` (after fee deduction)
   - User receives exactly what they were promised

### 4. Fee Calculation Utility

**File: `src/utils/withdrawal-fee.utility.ts`**

The fee calculation utility provides:

- **Tiered Fee Structure**:
  - Tier 1: Up to 1M RWF (~$769 USD) ‚Üí 600 RWF fee (~$0.46 USD)
  - Tier 2: 1M-5M RWF (~$769-$3,846 USD) ‚Üí 1,200 RWF fee (~$0.92 USD)
  - Tier 3: Above 5M RWF (~$3,846+ USD) ‚Üí 3,000 RWF fee (~$2.31 USD)

- **Fee Doubling**: Certain withdrawal types (CARD, BANK) have doubled fees
- **Validation**: Ensures net amount is positive and meets minimum requirements

## Flow Diagrams

### User Withdrawal Request Flow

```
1. User requests withdrawal (amount: $100)
   ‚Üì
2. System calculates fee based on amount and method
   - Method: MOBILE ‚Üí fee = $0.46
   - Net amount = $100 - $0.46 = $99.54
   ‚Üì
3. Validation checks:
   ‚úì Net amount > 0? YES
   ‚úì User has sufficient balance? YES
   ‚Üì
4. Create withdrawal request in database:
   - amount: $100
   - feeAmount: $0.46
   - netAmount: $99.54
   - feeTier: "Tier 1 (Up to 1M RWF)"
   ‚Üì
5. Lock $100 in wallet (move to pendingBalance)
   ‚Üì
6. Return to user:
   "You will receive $99.54 after deducting $0.46 withdrawal fee"
```

### Admin Approval Flow

```
1. Admin reviews withdrawal request
   - Sees: amount = $100, netAmount = $99.54, fee = $0.46
   ‚Üì
2. Admin clicks "Approve"
   ‚Üì
3. System loads stored fee data:
   ‚úì feeAmount = $0.46
   ‚úì netAmount = $99.54
   ‚Üì
4. Validation:
   ‚úì netAmount > 0? YES
   ‚úì Payment provider configured? YES
   ‚Üì
5. Send payout to XentriPay:
   - Amount sent: $99.54 (net amount)
   ‚Üì
6. Create fee transaction record (for tracking)
   ‚Üì
7. User receives exactly $99.54
   ‚úì Fee properly deducted!
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Fee Calculation Logs**
   ```
   [WITHDRAWAL_REQUEST] Fee calculation:
     originalAmount: 100
     feeAmount: 0.46
     netAmount: 99.54
     feeTier: "Tier 1 (Up to 1M RWF)"
   ```

2. **Admin Approval Logs**
   ```
   [ADMIN_SERVICE] ‚úÖ Using stored withdrawal fee from request:
     originalAmount: 100
     storedFee: 0.46
     storedNetAmount: 99.54
   ```

3. **Payment Transaction Records**
   - Two records created per withdrawal:
     - Main withdrawal transaction (type: WITHDRAWAL, amount: netAmount)
     - Fee transaction (type: WITHDRAWAL_FEE, amount: feeAmount)

### Alerts to Set Up

- ‚ùå Alert if `netAmount <= 0` in any withdrawal request
- ‚ùå Alert if withdrawal approved without fee data (legacy fallback triggered)
- ‚ùå Alert if XentriPay receives amount ‚â† netAmount

## API Changes

### POST `/api/payments/withdrawal/verify-and-withdraw`

**New Response Format:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Withdrawal request created. You will receive 99.54 USD after deducting the 0.46 USD withdrawal fee.",
  "data": {
    "withdrawalId": "clxyz...",
    "amount": 100,
    "feeAmount": 0.46,
    "netAmount": 99.54,
    "feeTier": "Tier 1 (Up to 1M RWF)",
    "currency": "USD",
    "method": "MOBILE",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "reference": "WD-1234567890-123",
    "newBalance": 900,
    "feeNote": "A withdrawal fee of 0.46 USD will be deducted. You will receive 99.54 USD."
  }
}
```

### POST `/api/payments/withdrawal/calculate-fee`

No changes - already returns fee calculation.

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added fee tracking fields
2. ‚úÖ `src/routes/withdrawal.routes.ts` - Fee calculation and validation
3. ‚úÖ `src/services/admin.service.ts` - Use stored fees, validate
4. ‚úÖ `src/utils/withdrawal-fee.utility.ts` - Already existed (no changes needed)

## Database Migration

**Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

Migration applied successfully via `npx prisma db push`

New columns added to `withdrawal_requests` table:
- `feeAmount` (Float, default 0)
- `netAmount` (Float, nullable)
- `feeTier` (String, nullable)

## Security Guarantees

### üîí Guarantees Provided:

1. ‚úÖ **Fee always calculated before request creation**
2. ‚úÖ **User informed of exact amount they will receive**
3. ‚úÖ **Fee stored immutably in database**
4. ‚úÖ **Admin uses stored fee (no recalculation)**
5. ‚úÖ **Payment provider receives only net amount**
6. ‚úÖ **Validation at multiple layers**
7. ‚úÖ **Clear audit trail via fee transactions**

### üö´ Impossible Scenarios (Now Prevented):

1. ‚ùå User receiving full amount without fee deduction
2. ‚ùå Fee calculated differently at approval vs request time
3. ‚ùå Negative net amounts being processed
4. ‚ùå Withdrawal processed without fee information

## Summary

The withdrawal fee enforcement system now provides **complete protection** against users receiving withdrawals without proper fee deduction:

- ‚úÖ Fee calculated and stored at request time
- ‚úÖ User sees exact net amount before confirming
- ‚úÖ Admin uses stored fee values (no surprises)
- ‚úÖ Payment provider receives net amount only
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail maintained
- ‚úÖ Multiple validation layers prevent errors

**Result: Users will NEVER receive withdrawal amounts without proper fee deduction! üéâ**
