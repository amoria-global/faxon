# Withdrawal Method Approval System

## Overview

The Withdrawal Method Approval System ensures that all user-submitted withdrawal methods (bank accounts and mobile money accounts) are reviewed and approved by administrators before they can be used for withdrawals. This adds an additional security layer to prevent fraud and ensure account details are valid.

## Features

### 1. User Workflow
- Users can add withdrawal methods (Bank or Mobile Money)
- Withdrawal methods are created with `isApproved: false` status
- Users are notified their method is pending approval
- Users receive email notifications when their method is approved or rejected
- Only approved methods can be used for actual withdrawals

### 2. Admin Workflow
- Admins receive email notifications when users submit new withdrawal methods
- Email includes complete user and account information for verification
- Admins can review pending withdrawal methods through the admin panel
- Admins can approve or reject withdrawal methods with reasons
- All actions are logged with admin ID and timestamp

### 3. Email Notifications

# Admin Email for Withdrawal Method Notifications
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@jambolush.com

# Email Service (Brevo)
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@jambolush.com

## Security Considerations

### 1. Approval Required
- No withdrawal can be processed using an unapproved method
- The withdrawal endpoint checks `isApproved` flag before processing
- Users cannot bypass approval by manipulating requests

### 2. Admin Verification Checklist
Email to admins includes a checklist:
- ‚úÖ Verify account details match user identity
- ‚úÖ Ensure account number format is valid
- ‚úÖ Check for suspicious activity or duplicate submissions
- ‚úÖ Approve or reject with appropriate reason

### 3. Masked Account Information
- User approval/rejection emails show masked account numbers
- Only last 4 digits are visible for security
- Full details are only visible to admins

### 4. Audit Trail
All approval/rejection actions are logged with:
- Admin user ID
- Timestamp
- Reason (for rejections)
- This creates a complete audit trail

    where: { id: withdrawalMethodId }
  });

  // ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHECK
  if (!savedMethod.isApproved) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Withdrawal method is not yet approved by admin. Please wait for approval or use a different method.'
